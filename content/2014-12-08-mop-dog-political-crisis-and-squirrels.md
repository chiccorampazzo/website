The last weekend I went to a &ldquo;house warming party&rdquo;. To what? Yes, I never heard this saying either. It
isn&rsquo;t a party about global warming&nbsp; or something that ended with a house in flames [unfortunatly], but in
plain words it is a party for showing your new flat, villa, apartment to your friends. An italian easy-minded like
me will call it party, dinner or &ldquo;serata&rdquo; (evening), but Swedish and Nepalese people are more
sophisticated! ;)
[Making enemies in Sweden, you are doing it right!]
You know that Italians can have a little delay. Little. On the contrary, Swedes take in high esteem punctuality. So,
I arrived with only two minutes of delay. I&rsquo;ve been the first. And I was there thinking &ldquo;aaah ah so
there are some exceptions&rdquo;. Parties are the exceptions. Next time I will be more Italian and I will listen to
Italian friend.

For the no italian reader. Marip: Delay at the parties is a duty.

The party has been really nice [captatio benevolentiae, in english, I just learned is &ldquo;winning of
goodwill&rdquo;] and people too.
At the party I talked a lot. I have this problem indeed: in thirty minutes I can have a clever speech, but more than
one weird&nbsp;talks. So, I started discussing if the swedish squirrels go or not in hibernation. There were
different ideas that night, so now I googled it and <strong><span style="color: #2a2a2a; font-size: medium;">"No,
squirrels do not hibernate, but they do sleep a lot!"&nbsp;</span></strong>[I found the answer in this
website:&nbsp;http://www.squirrelnutrition.com/blog/do-squirrels-hibernate (I'm really afraid of PLAGIARISM also
here)].
Then, I made the conversation converge&nbsp;on the political crisis of the Swedish government [<strong>this was the
clever one</strong>]. Swedes are really proud to be the forerunner in the demographic and family transitions,
I'm not so proud to come from the country in which&nbsp;most of the governments ended before their time [I'm
purposely not clear in this passage, because I didn't find unanimous data on the internet]. However, Swedes elected
the new government in September, but they're going to new elections in March. The lasts disagreement were on the
budget, but the fact is that the 13% of the population voted for the Sweden Democrats, which has been several times
tagged like neo-fascist party. One of the Swedes that night said that he is disappointed from all the politician
[pare detta da un'italiano questa frase] and it is an easier and also unpredictable solution this one of new
election. We will see!

And last but not least, I presented to many nationalities the so called mop dog or "mocio dog".
Be grateful.
